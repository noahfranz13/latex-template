# latex-template
Template files for LaTeX files and such hosted on Github. You should use this repo as a template when creating paper repos. Or, you can just copy the files out of it and put them in a different repo.

Essentially, the goal of this is to create an open source and more collaborative version of LaTeX editing (that is free...). Everytime code is pushed to the repo the PDF should be auto compiled by a GitHub repo. 

### Current Limitations
* Texfile to compile to a pdf must be names main.tex

### [PDF File](./main.pdf)
